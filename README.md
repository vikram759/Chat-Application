## Realtime Chat App

A real-time chat application whose style is heavily inspired by WhatsApp. Built using the MERN Stack (`MongoDB`, `Express.js`, `React`, `Node.js`) with `Firebase` for file storage and `Socket.IO` for instant messaging.

> [!WARNING]
> Messages sent in direct messages and group chats are **_not encrypted_** and are stored as **_plain text_** in the database. **DO NOT share** sensitive information, such as passwords, financial details, or any private data that you use in other applications or accounts. Use this chat app only for the purpose of previewing a demo application.
